# Vite-React App with TogglePlan, Cards, and Footer Components

This project is a simple React application that includes three main components: `TogglePlan`, `Cards`, and `Footer`. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS and demonstrates basic component structure and state management in React.

## Components

### TogglePlan

The `TogglePlan` component allows users to toggle between monthly and annual plans. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the toggle button.
